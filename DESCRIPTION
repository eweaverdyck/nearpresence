Description: Performs Near Presence Cluster Analysis, a method of
    identifying clustering in irregularly distributed, areal units with
    presence / absence data. IDW_nnear() calculates the inverse distance from
    every unit to its n nearest neighbors. IDW_radius() calculates the inverse 
    distance from every unit to every other unit within a specified distance. 
    The output is a spatial weights list. NP() uses this spatial weights list to
    weight presence/absence data to calculate a near pesence (NP) score for 
    every unit. NP outputs a spatial object with a variety of attributes 
    describing the significance of the NP scores and cluster membership.
